Qualitative analysis of ChatGPT-generated completion on a legal subject.

Due to model parameters that control for randomness in the completions generated by ChatGPT, we set a sample size of 120 completions to analyze 
the content of recommendations for measures related to the impact of nuclear energy on ecology. We introduced a minor change in the presented prompt, 
and analyzed whether the recommendations change with a qualitative analysis.
